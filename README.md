# Bookworm

A project for a course called Internet technologies 

A web site for selling books online.

Made by Veronika Gjoreva and Vasko Donev.

It features a database that my fellow colleague Vasko Donev made specifically for this project that contained images of the covers of the books, their titles, a description, the name of the book and the author and their prices. The home page is static with just a book suggestion from us and a "Quote of the day" section. The next page has a tree map with all of the categories in the database, a DataList section with the books from the selected category (or the default one - the first category in the tree map), a sorting drop down list that you could use to sort the books by their name, price or the release year. You can add books to your shopping cart and access the cart at any time you'd like.
